
1.What is Software

---> Software : its a piece of code written in a statment/token which having some task to perform.

2.Software Engineering :

---> Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintainig software. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools and methodoloies , including reuirements analysis, design, testing and maintenance.

* How many type of software are there??

---> Three type software
   1) System Software     --> Hardware ( webcam drivers).
   2) Programing Software --> Compiler,interper,assembler,remov,move,delete.
   3) Web Application     --> Software that runs in your web browser. 


* SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle

---> Six phases of SDLC
   1) Requirement static
                /Dynamic  : Requirement is the most crucial step in creating a successful system, during this phase you decide exactly what you want to do and the problems 
                           you are trying to slove.

   2) Analysis            : Software analysis is the process of collating factual data, identify software flaws, understanding the               
                           information architecture and developing solutions to overcome the weaknesses of the project.

   3) Desiging            : Identifies the design architecture of the project and all functional and non-functional requiments of the                                                              
                           project.

   4) Coding /Implement   : The developers build the cods, test, integrate and manage

   5) Testing             : After devlopment testing helps to find bugs and errors of the software.

   6) Maintaince          : In the maintenace stage, users may find bugs and errors that were missed in the ealier testing phase. These bugs need to be fixed for better  
                           user experience and retention.
